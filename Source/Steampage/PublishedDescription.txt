[h1][b]# The colony's biome changes every 60 days. (can edit in option)[/b][/h1]
- Tile, Animals, plants, temperature change
- Not destroy : Constructed floors, buildings, anima trees, sea, river, water(option)

[h1][b]# No lag[/b][/h1]
- It runs smoothly with no lag.
- Biomes! mod series may cause more lag than other mods when changing.
- If you are experiencing lag, change the 'change tick' in the options to a larger number. (Instead, Map tiles take longer to change.)


[h1][b]# The entire map changes over about 12 days[/b][/h1]
- This is a real play capture.
